# Project Title:
Data-Driven Housing Analysis using EDA,  Visualization, and Machine Learning Algorithm for  Price Prediction.
# Tools and Technology:
1. Advance Excel
2. Power Bi
# Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to analyze a housing price detection dataset and perform 
various tasks to gain insights and build machine learning models. The tasks 
include:
# Task 1: 
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the housing price detection dataset. 
# Task 2: 
Utilize the seaborn and matplotlib libraries to visualize the data and gain further 
insights.
# Task 3:
Apply the concepts of linear and logistic regression to build machine learning 
models for predicting housing prices.
# Task 4: 
Evaluate the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms such as KNN and 
DTfor predicting housing prices.
# Task 5: 
Create a confusion matrix to validate the final output of the machine learning 
models.
# Task 6: 
Generate visualizations and insights for recommendations based on the analyzed 
data.
## By completing these tasks, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the  housing price dataset, build accurate prediction models, and provide valuable recommendations and insights.
# Conclusion:
After conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the housing price 
detection dataset and utilizing the seaborn and matplotlib libraries for 
visualization, we gained valuable insights into the data. We applied linear and 
logistic regression to build machine learning models for predicting housing 
prices. We also evaluated the accuracy of different machine learning 
algorithms, including KNN and DT, for predicting housing prices.
To validate the final output of the machine learning models, we created a 
confusion matrix, which provided a detailed breakdown of true positives, true 
negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This allowed us to assess the 
performance of the models and make informed decisions for improvement.
Based on the analyzed data, we generated visualizations and insights that 
helped in making recommendations. These insights included the relationship 
between the number of bedrooms and the price of properties, the impact of 
different levels of furnishing on property prices, and more.
In conclusion, by conducting EDA, utilizing visualization libraries, building 
machine learning models, evaluating accuracy, creating a confusion matrix, 
and generating insights, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the 
housing price dataset and made informed recommendations for further 
analysis and decision-making.
